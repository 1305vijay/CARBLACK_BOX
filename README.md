# CARBLACK_BOX

🚗 Car Black Box Project (PIC16F877A)

📝 Description

This Car Black Box Project is a microcontroller-based event data recorder developed using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. It mimics the functionality of an aircraft black box by continuously monitoring and logging critical vehicle data such as collision detection, speed status (simulated), and key events.

The project was built and tested using MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB XC8 Compiler, and PICSimLab, making it fully open-source and hardware-simulation-friendly.

🔧 Key Features

🕒 Logs real-time events with timestamps

💾 Saves data to UART/serial console or simulated memory (EEPROM in real-world)

🔄 Reset and restart logging automatically after crash

🔌 Designed using MPLAB X IDE and tested in PICSimLab
